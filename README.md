# Customer Feedback Classifier

The goal is to classify customer feedback messages into three categories: compliment, complaint and suggestion.

The three main scripts are: 1-eda: for exploratory data analysis, 2-preprocessing: for different transformations on the given data to prepare for eda and training; and 3-models: for training a model and testing and/or making predictions.

run the desired script by: 
`python run.py model path1 path2 path3`. 

"model" takes the following strings: "eda", "train"
